		<p> My Name is Han Liu, I am 14 years old and I go to the school Victoria Park Collegiate Institute. I have a brother and sister, I love to read memes and I got some really weird thoughts. Some of my weirdest thoughts
		are, if you had ten differently sized tacos, how would you eat them? Would you eat some and save some for later? Would you eat them all at once from smallest to biggest? Would you eat them randomly? Or would you give the tacos 
		to someone else?</p>
