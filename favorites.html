		<h1> Things I Like/Enjoy Doing! </h1>
		<p> 
			One thing I really enjoy doing is playing games with my friends. Why you may ask? I like playing with my friends mostly because we always do something funny or something to laugh at almost every single time we play!
			It's also a lot more fun with friends because you can call and talk with them during the game and win the game. And games in general are very fun. <br>
			
			My favorite colors are blue and green because in my opinion the different shades of blue look really clear, calm and remind me of a really cool and beautiful island. The color green reminds me of a kiwi, its small but its tasty.
			<br>
			Some of my favorite foods include hotdogs and burgers or any type of junk food in general, rice, and okra. I like junk food because most junk foods are really, really, REALLY delicious! I like rice the most though because
			in my opinion rice pairs really well with any kind of food. But okra and eggs would be my favorite chinese dish just because it tastes amazing with rice!
