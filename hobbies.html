		<p> The games I play the most includes Valorant, League of legends and Minecraft. Valorant is made by a company called <a href = "https://www.riotgames.com/en"> Riot Games </a>. Valorant is a 5v5 fps shooter game that I play with my friends a lot, it is really fun, and even more fun when we win! I like playing valorant the most though
		because I can play the game with my friends. Valorant is also a somewhat easier game than most other fps games which is what makes it really appealing to me, it is also free which makes it so much better than most other fps games.
		I play League of Legends mostly because most of my friends play it and the company that made Valorant made League of Legends as well, so I just tried playing it and it was fun so to this day I still play it! I play minecraft sometimes when I'm bored and
		I usually play with my friends but on the rare occasion I play by myself. I mostly play on Hypixel and rarely play on singleplayer.</p>
		
		
		
		<h1 id = "Badminton"> <u> Badminton </u> </h1>
		
		<img class = "badmintonimage" src = "images/badminton.jpg" alt = "badminton">

		<p> I like laying badminton a lot because unlike other sports, like soccer or basketball, you don't need to run a lot which means I can just stand still and still be able to have fun :D. Badminton is also fun to me because its very easy to hit the birdy
		and it feels amazing when you hit a really hard shot (for example, hitting the birdy with your mouth between your legs). Although its hard to play badminton outside because of wind conditions, I still find it very...very....FUNNNNN.</p>

		<h1 id = "Walking"> <u> Walking </u> </h1> 
		
		<img class = "hikeimage" src = "images/hike.jpg" alt = "hiking image">
		
		<p> I like walking with my family because it feels really nice to be surrounded by trees on a hike and just feeling a cool breeze blow past you while walking. I like trails near bodies of water because most of the times, the sun, trees and scenery reflect off the water and
		if looks very pretty in a photo. What I don't like about trails is if they have a steep climb, its really hard to come back down from a steep slope.</p>
